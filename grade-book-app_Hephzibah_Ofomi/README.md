Brief Introduction
The Grade Book application is a robust tool designed to manage student records, course registrations, and GPA calculations using Python. The development employs several key programming techniques, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to structure the application, data structures like lists for storing and managing records, loops for iterating through data, and functions for modular and reusable code. This application serves as a practical example of how various programming concepts can be integrated to create a functional and interactive system.
